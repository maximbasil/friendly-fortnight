    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I built my first website at age 15 in 2017 while attending JKUAT via a Zalego scholarship. My project—a job recruitment platform for home workers—took a year to develop under mentor Mr. Alfred Omondi’s guidance. We sold it for Ksh 45,000, teaching me early on the power of websites and apps to transform businesses.</p>
    <p>Since then, I’ve grown into a full-stack creative: front-end developer, designer, business strategist, and marketer. I leverage AI tools and design thinking to deliver custom sites in under a week.</p>

    <h2>Why SEO Matters</h2>
    <p>SEO (Search Engine Optimization) helps potential clients find you when searching online. I guide you through each step—from keyword research like “women’s clothing Nairobi” to optimizing page loading speed and content structure.</p>
    <p>With simple SEO, your site goes from just existing to becoming discoverable, driving traffic and converting leads into customers.</p>
